- **Platforms**: linux/amd64, linux/arm64

### Adding to Existing Docker Compose
Add this service to your existing `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  ljx-booking-app:
    profiles: ["default"]
    container_name: ljx-booking-app
    image: ashayc/ljx-booking-app:latest
    environment:
      - PUID=${PUID}
      - PGID=${PGID}
      - TZ=${TZ}
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=3001
      - DATABASE_URL=/app/data/database.sqlite
      - FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3100
    ports:
      - "3100:3000"  # Frontend (adjust if port conflicts)
      - "3101:3001"  # Backend API
    volumes:
      - ljx-booking-data:/app/data
      - ljx-booking-logs:/app/logs
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3001/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
    networks:
      - your_network_name  # Replace with your network

volumes:
  ljx-booking-data:

```

### Building and Pushing New Images
Use the provided script to build and push multi-platform images:

```bash
# Option 1: Use npm script (recommended)
npm run docker:build-push

# Option 2: Use script directly
chmod +x scripts/build-and-push.sh
./scripts/build-and-push.sh your-dockerhub-username

# Option 3: With a specific tag

- Pause/resume jobs as needed
- Monitor success rates and error messages
- Delete completed or unwanted jobs

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Backend (.env)
```env
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL=database.sqlite
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

#### Frontend
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### Docker Configuration
The application uses Docker Compose with:
- Backend service on port 3001
- Frontend service on port 3000
- Persistent volumes for database and logs
- Health checks and restart policies

## Booking Logic

### How It Works
1. **Scheduler runs every 5 minutes** checking for active booking jobs
2. **For each job**, the system:
   - Checks if the amenity is available for booking
   - Verifies user isn't blacklisted
   - Finds the best available time slot
   - Attempts to make the reservation
   - Updates job status and statistics

### Booking Strategies
- **One-time**: Attempts booking until successful or date passes
- **Daily**: Books for the next available day
- **Weekly**: Books for the same day next week
- **Monthly**: Books for the same day next month
- **Always**: Continuously books available slots within the next 7 days

### Error Handling
- Automatic retries for transient failures
- Job deactivation after 10 consecutive failures
- Comprehensive error logging and user notifications

## Data Models

### User
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  unitNumber: string;
  residentId: string; // From ResPage verification
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

### Booking Job
```typescript
interface BookingJob {
  id: string;
  user: User;
  amenityId: string;
  amenityName: string;
  bookingType: 'one_time' | 'recurring';
  status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  
  // One-time booking fields
  targetDate?: Date;
  targetTime?: string;
  
  // Recurring booking fields
  recurrenceFrequency?: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'always';
  preferredTime?: string;
  preferredDaysOfWeek?: number[];
  endDate?: Date;
  
  // Statistics
  successfulBookings: number;
  failedAttempts: number;
  lastAttempt?: Date;
  lastSuccessfulBooking?: Date;
  errorMessage?: string;
}
```

## Monitoring & Logging

### Health Monitoring
- Backend health endpoint at `/health`
- Frontend health check via nginx
- Scheduler status monitoring
- Database connectivity checks

### Logging
- Comprehensive Winston logging
- Separate log files for errors and general logs
- Request/response logging
- Booking attempt audit trail

### Metrics Tracked
- Total booking jobs (active/completed/failed)
- Success rate per amenity
- System uptime and scheduler status
- User activity and registration stats

## Security Features

- **Rate limiting** on API endpoints
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **CORS configuration** for frontend access
- **Helmet.js** security headers
- **Resident verification** through ResPage API
- **No sensitive data storage** (leverages ResPage for authentication)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Backend won't start
- Check if port 3001 is available
- Verify database permissions
- Check logs for detailed error messages

#### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Ensure backend is running on port 3001
- Check CORS configuration
- Verify API_URL environment variable

#### Bookings not working
- Check scheduler status via `/api/scheduler/status`
- Verify ResPage API connectivity
- Check user's blacklist status
- Review booking job error messages

### Debug Commands
```bash
# View backend logs
docker compose logs backend

# View frontend logs
docker compose logs frontend

# Check scheduler status
curl http://localhost:3001/api/scheduler/status

# Manual trigger booking processing
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/scheduler/trigger

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```
